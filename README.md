# Terraform Practicing and Testing
Practicing and testing various terraform configurations with AWS.

This is an ongoing project used to test various configurations for use in real-world environments.

There are various optimizations and changes that will need to be made which will be done as things
are tested and refined. This likely will not be a fully complete setup in its current state.
